## Setup
- If you don't have `npm`, `node`, and `npx`...install them:
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- Then run `npm i` to install the node packages

## Running
- use `npx vite` in the terminal to start the project
- in the terminal it should give you an address like `localhost:5173` where the animation is running

## Using CCapture
With the animation running, if you click in the browser window, hitting the spacebar will save off a capture from the beginning of that page load until you hit the spacebar key. Hitting it again will capture the animation since the last capture.
